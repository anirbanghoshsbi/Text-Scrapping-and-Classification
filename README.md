# Text-Scrapping-and-Classification
The objective of this assignment is to scrape a corpus of news articles from a set of web pages, pre-process the corpus, and evaluate the performance of automated classification of these articles in a supervised learning context. 

The assignment should be implemented as a single IPython Notebook (not a script). Your code should be clearly documented, using comments and Markdown cells to explain your code and results.
